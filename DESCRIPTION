Description: Generative Adversarial Networks are applied to generate generative data for a data source. In iterative training steps the distribution of generated data converges to that of the data source. An application of generative data is the created density value function which is used to classify data records. Reference: Goodfellow et al. (2014) <arXiv:1406.2661v1>.
